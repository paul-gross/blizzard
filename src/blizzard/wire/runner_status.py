"""The runner's machine-local status view — wire bodies (issue #51).

Behind ``GET /api/runner`` (identity, pause states, capacities, hub connectivity,
last tick), ``GET /api/environments`` (held bindings), ``GET /api/asks?open=true``
(open questions), and ``GET /api/escalations`` (parked escalations with their
literal resume command) — ``blizzard runner status``'s four reads. Modeled on
``wire/lease.py``'s and ``wire/runner.py``'s shapes; datetimes are ISO-8601
strings with an explicit UTC offset, serialized via ``foundation/store/utc.py``'s
``iso_utc`` (``bzh:utc-instants``).
