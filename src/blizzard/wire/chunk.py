Ingest wraps one or more source-native **tokens** into chunks (``POST /chunks``)

each against its configured PM sources (``IPmSourceRegistry.resolve``) and 422s a
token none of them claims, naming the token and the configured sources. A
resolved pointer already held by a live chunk is rejected **409** with the existing
chunk id. The list/detail views carry the **derived** status — never
a stored column — and the current node. ``GET /chunks/{id}/pm-items`` is the
vendor-native pass-through read — one entry per pointer, contents never
